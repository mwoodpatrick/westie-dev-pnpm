# k3d configuration file, saved as e.g. /home/me/myk3dcluster.yaml
# k3d expands environment variables ($VAR or ${VAR}) unconditionally in the config file, even before processing it in any way.
# k3d uses Cobra and Viper for CLI and general config handling respectively.
# This automatically introduces a “config option order of priority” (precedence order):
